3. Agent Pages
We need flexibility since not all agents have complete profiles in Mission Control yet.

                                 * Support agent subdomains like:

                                          * Add, edit, and remove redirects
                                          * Example: when an agent leaves, redirect their page to the agent team page

New Page Creation
                                             * Way to add:
                                             * New communities

                                                   * Ideally, pull live reviews directly from Google
                                                   * Display reviews on relevant pages (community or downtown pages if possible)

                                                      * If we proceed with Vercel and move away from WordPress, these capabilities are important for SEO, content growth, and ongoing marketing performance.

Admin Backend - Content Management 
The CLAWD admin dashboard has solid foundations (SEO fields, schema support, redirects, and review integrations), but there are several blocking issues that need to be fixed before it is usable for day-to-day content and SEO work.
Main blockers:
                                                      * Dashboard shows data (communities, blog posts, agents), but none of it appears in the actual CMS views. This makes content unmanageable.
                                                      * Global Scripts page is broken (blank screen), which blocks adding tracking like GA, GTM, Meta Pixel, etc.
                                                      * Review Sources page returns a 404.
                                                      * Preview redirects to the live site, making QA and staging validation confusing.
                                                      * Admin navigation changes unexpectedly when editing blogs, which breaks workflow.
UX and workflow gaps:
                                                      * We need an image upload button, right now it requires pasting image URLs manually.
                                                      * Page builder relies heavily on raw HTML and has a confusing split between “main content” and “sections.”
                                                      * Page type options are unclear and need better explanation.
Overall:
The backend is close in terms of features, but stability, data visibility, and CMS usability need to be addressed first. Once these blockers are fixed, we can refine the editor experience and scale content workflows more confidently.
Detailed Admin Dashboard Review
This QA focuses on data visibility issues, CMS usability, missing functionality, and editor experience.
1. Dashboard Data Mismatch
Issue: Data showing in the dashboard but not accessible in CMS views
                                                      * Dashboard shows:
                                                      * 24 communities
                                                      * 156 blog posts
                                                      * 50 agents

                                                         * When navigating to:
                                                         * Communities: Shows “No communities found”
                                                         * Blog posts: No posts appear, even when searching known recent posts
                                                         * Agents: Shows “No agents found” despite dashboard count
Impact
                                                         * Creates confusion and blocks content management
                                                         * Suggests possible:
                                                         * Data sync issue
                                                         * Permissions issue
                                                         * API or indexing issue between dashboard summary and actual CMS records

Recommendation
                                                            * Investigate why records appear in dashboard metrics but not in the content tables
                                                            * Confirm:
                                                            * Correct environment (prod vs staging)
                                                            * Correct user permissions
                                                            * API/data source being used by dashboard widgets
2. Navigation & Admin UX Issues
Sidebar View Switching
                                                            * When clicking Blog Posts, the left sidebar switches from admin view to an agent-style view
                                                            * This disrupts workflow and is confusing from a CMS perspective
Recommendation
                                                            * Keep admin navigation consistent across all content sections

3. Blog Management
Categories
                                                               * Blog categories work as expected
                                                               * Able to add, edit, and delete categories
                                                               * No issues here
Blog Posts
                                                               * Posts visible in dashboard summary are not visible in content manager
                                                               * Search returns “No post matches your filters” even for recently updated posts
Recommendation
                                                               * Verify:
                                                               * Where the blog posts are located
                                                               * Filters applied by default
                                                               * Environment mismatch

                                                                  * Add:
                                                                  * Clear empty-state messaging
                                                                  * Ability to filter by status (draft, published, archived)

4. Landing Pages Builder UX
Image Management
                                                                     * Featured images and social images require pasting image URLs
                                                                     * No direct image upload option from the CMS UI
Impact
                                                                     * Adds unnecessary friction
                                                                     * Slows down page creation and updates
                                                                     * Error-prone when managing many images
Recommendation
                                                                     * Add native image upload support for:
                                                                     * Featured images
                                                                     * Social sharing images
                                                                     * Section images

                                                                     * This is good
Schema & Custom Scripts
                                                                     * Schema markup field is present
                                                                     * Custom script injection is available

Next Steps
This backend QA can serve as the baseline for stabilizing the CMS experience. Once the data visibility and broken admin routes are fixed, we can refine the editor UX and content workflows. From there, we can continue iterating on usability, automation, and content scaling features as real usage highlights additional needs.

                                                                                 * Buyer guides
                                                                                 * Videos (e.g. “Is it a good time to buy a home in Austin?”)
                                                                                 * Supporting CTAs and resource links
The live site version is SEO-optimized and content-rich. The Vercel version should aim for content parity.

These missing elements currently reduce both conversion and content depth.
8. Cash Offer and Trade-In Page
                                                                                    * Page looks solid overall

                                                                                    * Alternatively, manually curate top reviews

                                                                                    * Each major section should offer a next step (consultation, learn more, contact)
                                                                                    * Reduce friction by avoiding forcing users to scroll to top or bottom to convert

                                                                                    * Reviews page currently returns a 404
                                                                                    * Needs to be implemented or redirected properly
Summary
At a front-end level, the Vercel site is structurally sound, but it is currently missing a significant amount of optimized content and conversion elements compared to the live site. The main focus areas should be:
                                                                                    * Content parity with the live website
                                                                                    * Stronger conversion paths (pop-ups, CTAs, mid-page actions)
                                                                                    * Updated trust signals (reviews, stats, logos)
                                                                                    * Improved UX flow (navigation order, header CTAs, phone number visibility)
                                                                                    * Completing missing pages and sections
Next Steps
This QA can serve as the baseline. Once these core gaps are addressed, we can continue refining UX, CRO, and SEO elements as we test and gather real user behavior data. This gives us a strong foundation to move forward while allowing room to polish and iterate as additional needs surface.
02/17 Updates


02/17 - Backend
Spyglass Admin Content Management – Backend QA Report
  

Mission Control Pages
Issue: It is unclear whether the “Pages” section in Mission Control is intended for admin-only use or if non-admin users or agents can access and interact with these pages.
Recommendation: Please confirm intended access levels and permissions for the “Pages” section, including whether agents should have visibility or editing capabilities.
  

Site Editor and Homepage Builder
Issue: It is unclear whether the Site Editor in the left sidebar is exclusively for the Homepage Builder or intended to manage other site templates as well.
Recommendation: Clarify the scope of the Site Editor and whether it will be expanded to manage additional templates beyond the homepage.


Issue: Homepage sections do not allow selecting text formats such as H1, H2, H3, H4, or paragraph, which limits SEO control.
Recommendation: Add text formatting options to homepage sections to support proper heading hierarchy and SEO structure.
Landing Pages
Issue: Live view redirects to the live REW site instead of a development or backend preview environment.
Recommendation: Implement a backend preview or staging preview so pages can be reviewed safely during development.


Issue: Main Content and Sections appear to overlap in purpose, which creates confusion in content management.
Recommendation: Consolidate Main Content and Sections into a single content system to simplify editing workflows.


Issue: The current editor experience is limited and heavily dependent on raw inputs.
Recommendation: Add a formatting toolbar with HTML option and introduce a drag and drop or visual builder similar to Elementor.


Issue: Featured Image and Social Media Image require URL input instead of native file uploads.
Recommendation: Add native file upload buttons for Featured Image and Social Media Image fields.
Communities
Issue: Community pages are not accessible in the backend under Spyglass Admin Content Management, and there is no clear way to create or edit community content.


Recommendation: Provide backend access for creating, editing, and managing community pages and document the intended workflow for community content management.
Blog Posts
Issue: Featured Image and Social Media Image fields only accept URLs.
Recommendation: Replace URL-only fields with native file upload functionality.


Issue: The blog content editor lacks a formatting toolbar and HTML editing option.
Recommendation: Add a rich text formatting bar with heading options and an HTML mode for advanced editing.


Issue: Creating a blog post from the backend results in a “failed to save blog post” error and shows unsaved changes.
Recommendation: Investigate and resolve the save error to ensure blog posts can be created and published reliably.
Agents
Issue: Agents who serve multiple cities cannot select more than one market in the backend.
Recommendation: Allow multi-select for agent service areas or cities.


Issue: Headshot image field requires a URL instead of supporting native uploads.
Recommendation: Add native file upload support for agent headshots.


Issue: The meaning and function of “sort order” in advanced settings is unclear.
Recommendation: Clarify what “sort order” controls and default the main agent directory to alphabetical sorting by last name while maintaining First Name Last Name display format.


Issue: Editing and saving an agent profile triggers a “Validation File Error.”
Recommendation: Investigate and resolve validation errors to allow agent profile updates.


Issue: There is no way to preview an agent page from the backend.
Recommendation: Add a preview or open-in-new-tab option for agent profile pages to support QA and verification.
Global Scripts
Issue: The Global Scripts section loads a blank page and is not accessible.
Recommendation: Fix the Global Scripts route and ensure sitewide scripts can be managed from the backend.
Sitewide UX and Error Handling
Issue: Error messages such as “failed to save file” or “validation file error” do not indicate which field is causing the problem.
Recommendation: Improve error messaging by highlighting or indicating the specific fields that require correction.
Redirects and Migration
Issue: There is no clear guidance on redirect migration strategy from the existing REW Spyglass website.
Recommendation: Confirm whether all existing redirects should be migrated or if only recent and high priority redirects should be moved into Mission Control.


02/17 - Frontend
Frontend QA Report - Vercel.app
Navigation Menu
Issue: The Blogs link is missing from the main navigation menu.
Recommendation: Add the Blogs link to the primary navigation so users can easily access blog content from any page.
Homepage
Issue: It is unclear whether the homepage content will be updated or if the existing content from the REW homepage will be reused.
Recommendation: Confirm the content strategy for the homepage and align it with the current optimized REW homepage content if SEO and messaging continuity are required.


Issue: Accolades and trust logos (Leading RE, Inc 5000, ABJ, RealTrends) are missing from the homepage.
Recommendation: Add the missing accolade and trust logos to reinforce brand credibility and trust signals.


Issue: The call to action in the “What brings you here” section is not visually prominent and the text is difficult to see.
Recommendation: Increase contrast and visual prominence of the call to action button to improve visibility and conversion.


Issue: Featured Listings currently do not clearly display office listings.
Recommendation: Configure Featured Listings to surface office listings as intended.


Issue: The contact form combines email and phone into a single field.
Recommendation: Separate email and phone into distinct form fields to improve data quality and usability.
Buying Page
Issue: The Buying page is missing significant content compared to the live site.
Recommendation: Populate the Buying page with the same core content from the live website to maintain content parity and SEO value, or implement a structured way to migrate content from spyglassrealty.com/buy-home-austin.
Selling Page
Issue: The Selling page is missing significant content compared to the live site.
Recommendation: Populate the Selling page with the same core content from the live website to maintain content parity and SEO value, or implement a structured way to migrate content from spyglassrealty.com/sell-home-austin.
Zip Codes Page
Issue: The “Austin and Surrounding Area Zip Codes” section is not loading correctly.
Recommendation: Investigate and fix the loading issue to ensure all zip code content displays properly.


Issue: There is no call to action at the bottom of the zip codes page.
Recommendation: Add a clear call to action at the bottom of the zip codes page to guide users toward next steps.


Issue: The zip code pages are missing the site footer.
Recommendation: Restore the footer on zip code pages to maintain consistent navigation and trust signals across the site.
Sitewide Content Parity and SEO
Issue: Core pages, landing pages, and community pages on the Vercel site are missing substantial content that exists on the live spyglassrealty.com website, including internal and external links.
Recommendation: Migrate or recreate core content and internal and external links from the live site to the Vercel site to preserve SEO equity, content depth, and user experience across all key pages.
