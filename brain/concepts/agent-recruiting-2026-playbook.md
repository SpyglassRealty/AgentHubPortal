# 🎯 2026 Agent Recruiting Playbook for Spyglass Realty

## The Macro Thesis

2026 is a **performance separation cycle**. All four conditions for peak recruiting activity are present:
1. Transaction volume slowed
2. Commission pressure rising (NAR settlement ripple effects)
3. Split dissatisfaction increasing at traditional firms
4. Technology gaps becoming visible

**This is not a downturn. It's a talent reallocation event.**

## Agent Migration Data (2025 Actuals)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Annual agent turnover | 6.8% (up from 6.0%) |
| Volume that moved between brokerages | $15.72 billion |
| Avg productive agents moving per month per MLS | ~350 |
| Peak movement months | **January** and **April** |
| Internal transfer retention (12-month) | 89% |
| External recruit retention (12-month) | 76% |
| Internal transfer productivity advantage | +24% |
| Distressed migrations (survival moves) | ~33% of all moves |

## Who's Moving and Why

### Target Agent Profiles
1. **Agents in transition** — Production dropped 15-25%. Looking for lifeline.
2. **Agents at shrinking offices** — Negative net growth = flight risk for them.
3. **Niche specialists** — Relocation, investors, commercial-adjacent agents underserved by generalist brokerages.
4. **Data-driven performers** — Want analytics and systems, not cheerleading.
5. **Distressed migrators** — 60%+ buyer-side agents whose business dropped. Need leads + support.

### Why Agents Leave (Exit Interview Themes)
- "I need to survive" / "I need to cut costs" (splits)
- "I want better technology/tools"
- "I want more support/leads"
- "I want to be seen, not just a number"
- "I want leadership that invests in me"

## Competitive Landscape

### The Compass-Anywhere Threat
- Created 50%+ market share in many metros via merger
- Using private listing network (PLN) as recruiting tool
- Tech stack now available to all Anywhere agents
- **Counter:** Boutique + tech beats mega-firm generics. Personal service at scale.

### The eXp/Real Broker Model
- Cloud-based, rev-share driven recruiting
- eXp launched "FastAttract" program for team recruiting in 2026
- Real Broker growing aggressively with similar model
- **Counter:** Rev-share ≠ support. Spyglass offers both income AND infrastructure.

### Independent/Boutique Advantage
- Personalized support and culture
- Faster decision-making and tech adoption
- Agents feel "seen" vs. anonymous
- Can niche down (luxury, relocation, etc.)
- **This is Spyglass's lane.**

## Spyglass Competitive Advantages for Recruiting

| What Agents Want | What Spyglass Offers |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Better splits | ✓ Competitive structure |
| Technology/tools | ✓ Mission Control (CMA, Market Pulse, dashboards) |
| Market intelligence | ✓ Pulse V2 with real-time data |
| Onboarding support | ✓ 26-step automated onboarding system (NEW) |

## Recruiting Timing Strategy

### Q1 (January-March) — PEAK SEASON ← WE ARE HERE
- January is historically highest movement month
- Agents evaluating after slow winter
- New Year = fresh start mentality
- **ACTION: Maximum recruiting effort NOW**

### Q2 (April-June) — SECOND PEAK
- April is second highest movement month
- Spring market starting = agents thinking about where they want to be
- **ACTION: Follow-up on Q1 pipeline, convert warm leads**

### Q3 (July-September) — MID-CYCLE
- Agents busy with summer transactions
- Less movement, more retention-focused
- **ACTION: Focus on retention, 90-day check-ins on new agents**

### Q4 (October-December) — PLANNING SEASON
- Agents start thinking about next year
- Holiday appreciation = retention tool
- **ACTION: Plant seeds, appreciation events, next-year planning meetings**

## Recruiting Pitch Script (For Ryan)

> "Look, I know what it feels like to be at a brokerage where you're a number. At Spyglass, here's what's different:

>
> 2. **We get you productive fast** — Our 26-step onboarding system means you're not figuring it out alone. FUB, MLS, marketing — we handle the setup so you focus on selling.
>
> 3. **We actually know you** — 179 agents, two offices. You're not anonymous. You have my cell phone.
>
> 4. **The math works** — [pull up commission calculator] At your current GCI, here's exactly what you'd keep at Spyglass vs. where you are now."
