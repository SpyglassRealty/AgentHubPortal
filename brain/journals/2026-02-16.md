# 🌙 Nightly Work Session — February 16, 2026

## Theme: Strategic Growth Intelligence + Market Research

Tonight's core question: **How does Ryan know if Spyglass is on pace for $1B and 300 agents?** The answer: he shouldn't have to wonder. So I built him a command center.

---

## What Got Built

### 🚀 Growth Intelligence Dashboard (THE main deliverable)
**Impact: Ryan's new strategic nerve center for the $1B goal**

Built a comprehensive admin dashboard page at `/admin/dashboards/growth` in Mission Control that answers every question a brokerage owner asks at 2am:

**Four tabs of intelligence:**

#### 📊 Pace Tab
- **Cumulative Volume vs $1B Goal** — Area chart showing actual YTD volume against the goal line. Instantly see if you're above or below pace.
- **Monthly Volume** — Bar chart with reference line showing what's needed per month
- **Monthly Transactions** — Bar chart with GCI line overlay
- **Pace Summary Cards** — Year progress %, YTD volume, monthly needed, projected annual

#### 👥 Agents Tab
- **Agent Production Tiers** — Four-tier system (Elite/Strong/Developing/Inactive) with volume, GCI, brokerage revenue, and avg deals per tier
- **Tier Distribution Pie Chart** — Visual of where volume comes from
- **Revenue Concentration Risk** — Top 10% and Top 20% contribution percentages, plus Gini coefficient (measures inequality of production distribution)
- **Risk Assessment** — Automated warning if too much revenue depends on too few agents

#### 💰 Economics Tab
- **Per-Agent Economics** — Annualized avg volume, GCI, brokerage revenue, and deals per agent
- **Scenario: 300 Agents at Current Productivity** — Projects what happens if we hit 300 agents with today's avg productivity. Does it hit $1B? Shows projected volume, GCI, brokerage revenue, and deals.
- **What's Needed to Hit $1B at 300 Agents** — Required volume/deals/GCI per agent vs current averages
- **Monthly Brokerage Revenue** — Chart showing GCI vs agent payouts vs what Spyglass keeps
- **Strategy Insight** — "Recruit productive agents AND coach developing agents up. Both levers matter."

#### 🏆 Leaderboard Tab
- **Top 25 Producers** — Ranked by volume with tier badges, GCI, deals, avg price, listing/buyer split, brokerage revenue contribution, and volume share %
- **Medal styling** — Gold/Silver/Bronze for top 3
- **Volume share bars** — Visual indicator of each agent's contribution to total volume

**Top KPI Row (always visible):**
- Volume → $1B progress bar with YoY comparison
- Agents → 300 progress (need X more, ~Y/month target)
- Pipeline (pending deals volume + GCI)
- Brokerage Margin %

**Technical details:**
- New API route: `/api/admin/growth-intelligence`
- Server-side: `server/growthIntelligenceRoutes.ts` (320 lines)
- Client: `client/src/pages/admin-dashboards/growth-intelligence.tsx` (850 lines)
- Navigation integrated into sidebar under "DASHBOARD" section
- 15-minute cache on all data, manual refresh button
- All data sourced from ReZen transaction API
- Feature branch: `feature/revenue-intelligence`

**Why this matters:**
- Every number Ryan cares about is on ONE page
- No more back-of-envelope math on "are we on pace?"
- The scenario modeling shows exactly what it takes to hit $1B
- The concentration risk analysis prevents a blind spot (what if your top 3 producers leave?)
- The tier system identifies who to coach, who to celebrate, who to recruit

## Market Research: Austin Housing Market — February 2026

### Key Data Points (from ABoR, KXAN, Redfin, local analysts):
- **Median sold price (Austin metro):** $400,495 (Jan 2026, down 2.3% YoY per KXAN)
- **Median sold price (City of Austin):** ~$500K per Redfin (down 3.6% YoY)
- **Days on market:** 88 days (highest since March 2011)
- **Active listings:** 10,372 across metro
- **Months of inventory:** 4.2 (balanced market territory)
- **Price cuts:** 53%+ of listings took price reductions
- **Mortgage rates:** ~6.1% (eased from peak)
- **Homestead exemption:** Jumped to $140K (200K for 65+)

### Market Bottom Forecast:
- Most analysts project bottom in Q2-Q3 2026
- Prices expected to stabilize in $430K-$440K range
- 2027: Modest 2-4% annual appreciation expected
- Job market: 3.4% unemployment, 1.6% employment growth

### What This Means for Spyglass:
1. **Agent pitch is strong:** "In a 88-DOM market, sellers NEED real support. That's what we provide."
2. **Buyer agents have more value now:** Full inspection periods, price negotiations, seller concessions. Buyers need skilled agents to navigate this.
3. **Recruiting opportunity:** Agents at big brokerages are seeing less support in a tougher market. Boutique + tech = compelling pitch.
4. **Volume pressure:** Lower prices mean more transactions needed for the same volume. The $1B goal requires ~2,500 transactions at $400K avg.
5. **Pipeline is key:** With 88 DOM, pipeline visibility matters more than ever. More deals are "in progress" at any given time.

## What to Test/Review

1. **Deploy to staging** and navigate to `/admin/dashboards/growth`
2. Verify all data populates from ReZen (needs active transactions)
3. Check tier classifications make sense for your agent roster
4. Review the $1B scenario — does the math feel right?
5. Look at the concentration risk — is it alarming? That's useful info.
6. Confirm the leaderboard matches your mental model of top producers

## What's Next
- Add Houston vs Austin geographic breakdown
- Connect to Beacon recruiting data for agent pipeline metrics
- Add agent retention signals (declining deal velocity, etc.)
- Weekly email digest of Growth Intelligence KPIs
- Historical trend comparison (monthly snapshots for progress tracking)
