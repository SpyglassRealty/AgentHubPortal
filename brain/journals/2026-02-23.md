# 🌙 Nightly Work Session — February 23, 2026

## Theme: Operationalizing Agent Growth

Tonight's question: **If Spyglass is going to add 121 agents this year, what systems need to exist to make that smooth?** The Feb 14 session designed the onboarding spec. Tonight, I built it.

---

## What Got Built

### 🚀 Agent Onboarding System — Phase 1 (THE main deliverable)
**Impact: Complete pipeline for tracking every new agent from signed → productive**

Turned the onboarding spec from Feb 14 into a working system inside Mission Control. This is the operational backbone for the 179 → 300 goal.

**What's in it:**

#### Database (3 new tables)
- `onboarding_templates` — Configurable checklist templates per office/agent type
- `agent_onboardings` — Active onboarding processes with checklist state, progress %, metadata
- `onboarding_activity` — Full audit trail (who did what, when)

#### Pre-built Templates
**Austin - Experienced Agent** (26 steps across 5 phases):
1. **Pre-Start Setup** (7 steps) — FUB account, ReZen profile, Mission Control, email, Slack, MLS transfer, business cards
2. **Day 1 - Welcome** (5 steps) — Welcome email, headshot, orientation, mentor assignment, office tour
3. **Week 1 - Ramp Up** (6 steps) — FUB training, Mission Control tour, IDX profile, team meeting, CRM import, marketing setup
4. **Month 1 - Activation** (5 steps) — First deal, 30-day check-in, goal setting, compliance, social announcement
5. **90-Day Milestone** (3 steps) — Performance review, satisfaction survey, growth plan

**Houston - Experienced Agent** (21 steps, 5 phases) — Same structure, Houston-specific details (HAR MLS, Houston photographers, Houston Slack channels)

Both templates include a **welcome email sequence** (Day 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 30, 60, 90) ready for Phase 2 automation.

#### API Endpoints (11 routes)
```
GET    /api/admin/onboarding              — List with status/office filters
GET    /api/admin/onboarding/:id          — Detail with template + activity log
POST   /api/admin/onboarding              — Start new onboarding
PATCH  /api/admin/onboarding/:id          — Update metadata/status
PATCH  /api/admin/onboarding/:id/step     — Toggle checklist step (auto-recalculates progress)
POST   /api/admin/onboarding/:id/note     — Add note to activity log
DELETE /api/admin/onboarding/:id          — Soft cancel
GET    /api/admin/onboarding/analytics    — Dashboard metrics
GET    /api/admin/onboarding/templates    — List templates
POST   /api/admin/onboarding/templates    — Create template
PATCH  /api/admin/onboarding/templates/:id — Update template
```

#### Admin UI (Full-featured, ~900 lines)
- **List View**: All onboardings with progress bars, status badges, search, office/status filters
- **KPI Cards**: In Progress count, Completed count, 2026 YTD (goal: 121), Average Progress %
- **New Onboarding Dialog**: Form with auto-template selection based on office, recruiting source tracking
- **Detail View**: 
  - Interactive checklist — click to toggle steps, auto-progress calculation
  - Phase-by-phase breakdown with completion counts
  - Status management (pause/resume/complete)
  - Info cards (office, start date, license, source)
  - Notes section with inline add
  - Activity log with timestamped audit trail
  - Completion metadata (who completed what step, when)
- **Navigation**: Added "Onboarding" under new "OPERATIONS" section in admin sidebar

#### Smart Features
- Auto-initializes checklist state from template when creating new onboarding
- Auto-marks as "completed" when all steps are checked (auto-reopens if unchecked)
- Progress percentage recalculates on every step toggle
- Full audit trail — every action logged with timestamp and user
- Recruiting source tracking enables funnel analysis (Beacon vs referral vs social)

**Files Changed:**

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `migrations/0009_agent_onboarding.sql` | NEW — Schema + default templates (15KB) |
| `server/onboardingRoutes.ts` | NEW — Full API (19KB) |
| `shared/schema.ts` | Added Drizzle ORM types for 3 tables |
| `server/routes.ts` | Registered onboarding routes |
| `client/src/pages/admin-dashboards/onboarding.tsx` | NEW — Admin UI (32KB) |
| `client/src/pages/admin-dashboards/index.tsx` | Added route |
| `client/src/components/admin-dashboards/dashboard-layout.tsx` | Added nav link |

**Branch:** `feature/agent-onboarding` — ready for review + merge

## Research: The Great Agent Reshuffle of 2026

### Key Findings from Industry Research

#### 1. Agent Migration Data (HousingWire / Recruiting Insight Report)
- **6.8% agent turnover** in 2025 (up from 6.0% in 2024)
- **$15.72 billion** in annual transaction volume migrated between brokerages
- ~350 productive agents move per month per MLS
- **Peak movement months: January and April** — recruiting efforts should spike then
- **One-third of moves were "distressed migrations"** — agents whose business dropped 18-24% seeking survival
- **Internal transfers are 24% more productive** ($1.516M avg vs $1.218M for external recruits)
- **89% of internal movers** retained at 12 months vs 76% external
- **Top 10% of movers controlled 45%** of $7B in volume — concentration risk is real

**Spyglass takeaway:** The retention data validates what we built tonight. Smooth onboarding → better retention → less volume risk. Also, January movement data confirms Q1 is prime recruiting season — Ryan should be aggressive right now.

#### 2. The Compass-Anywhere Mega-Merger Impact
- Compass's acquisition of Anywhere created 50%+ market share in many metros
- Three competitive levers for agents choosing brokerages: **splits, resources/tech, and culture**
- Compass using its private listing network as a recruiting tool
- **Boutique brokerages winning** by offering personalized support and culture that mega-firms can't match
- Third-party networks (like TAN) help smaller firms compete on exclusive inventory

**Spyglass takeaway:** This is Spyglass's sweet spot. "Boutique + tech" beats "mega-brokerage + generic support." The Commission Calculator, CMA tools, and Mission Control ARE the competitive advantage. Ryan should lean hard into "we're not Compass, and that's why you'll succeed here."

#### 3. The 2026 Recruiting Window (Brokers Recruiter Analysis)
All four conditions for a recruiting spike are present:
- ✔ Transaction volume slowed
- ✔ Commission pressure rising
- ✔ Split dissatisfaction increasing
- ✔ Technology gaps visible at traditional brokerages

**Target agent profiles for 2026:**
- Agents in transition (production dipped 15-25%)
- Agents at shrinking offices (negative net growth)
- Niche specialists (relocation, investors, commercial-adjacent)
- Data-driven performers (respond to analytics, not hype)

**Spyglass takeaway:** The market is literally handing Ryan the recruiting playbook. Agents are evaluating: split structure ✓, lead support ✓, technology access ✓ (Mission Control), market intelligence tools ✓ (Pulse), brokerage leadership ✓ (Ryan's personal brand). Every box is checked.

#### 4. Inman: "What Running a Brokerage in 2026 Actually Looks Like"
- Winning brokerages have **documented systems** (not just tools)
- They **operationalize technology** instead of just purchasing it
- They train agents to **articulate value** before showing a single property

**Spyglass takeaway:** This is exactly what tonight's onboarding system does — it's documented, operational, and systematic. Phase 2 should include a "value articulation" training step.

## What to Test/Review

### Onboarding System
1. **Deploy branch `feature/agent-onboarding` to staging**
2. Run migration `0009_agent_onboarding.sql` against the database
3. Navigate to `/admin/dashboards/onboarding` (must be super admin)
4. Test: Create a new onboarding → pick Austin template → check off steps → verify progress
5. Test: Search, filter by status/office, pause/resume
6. Test: Add notes, check activity log
7. Review: Do the 26 Austin checklist steps match your actual onboarding process?

### Quick Wins for Morning
- Is the template complete? Missing any steps specific to Spyglass?
- Should there be a "New Agent" template (different from experienced)?
- Any steps that should auto-trigger (e.g., creating FUB account via API)?

---

## What's Next (Phase 2-4)

### Phase 2: Automation (1-2 nights)
- Auto-create FUB contact when onboarding starts
- Welcome email sequence (triggered by start date)
- Slack webhook notifications for onboarding milestones
- IDX profile auto-creation

### Phase 3: Analytics Dashboard (1 night)
- Average onboarding completion time
- Bottleneck identification (which steps take longest)
- Time-to-first-deal by source, office
- Retention correlation with onboarding completion

### Phase 4: Agent Self-Service (1 night)
- New agent sees their own onboarding checklist
- Document upload (headshot, license, E&O)
- Progress tracker visible to the agent

## Strategic Insight

The research tonight confirmed something important: **2026 is a recruiting window, not a risk.** Every industry signal says agents are movable. But the brokerages winning the recruiting game in 2026 aren't the ones throwing money at splits — they're the ones with **systems, technology, and culture.**

Spyglass has all three. The onboarding system is the latest proof point. When Ryan sits across from a prospective agent and says "We have a 26-step automated onboarding process that gets you productive in days, not weeks" — that's a differentiator no franchise can match.

The 300-agent goal isn't aspirational. It's operational.
