### Fix: "View Training" Link Still Present - Remove It Completely

**Issue:** The "View Training →" link is still showing in the Company Updates header. It was not removed.

**Screenshot confirms:** The link is visible on the right side of "Company Updates" header.

**Action Required:** Find and DELETE the "View Training →" link completely.

---

## Search for this code and DELETE it:

Search the codebase for any of these patterns:

1. `View Training`
2. `href="/training"` near Company Updates
3. `ArrowRight` near Company Updates header

---

## Likely Location:

Check these files:
- `client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx`
- `client/src/components/dashboard/company-updates.tsx`
- `client/src/components/CompanyUpdates.tsx`

---

## Find code that looks like this and DELETE the entire Link/anchor:
```tsx
// DELETE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK:
<Link 
  href="/training"
  className="..."
>
  View Training
  <ArrowRight className="w-4 h-4" />
</Link>

// OR this format:
<a href="/training" className="...">
  View Training →
</a>

// OR with span:
<Link href="/training" className="...">
  <span>View Training</span>
  <ArrowRight ... />
</Link>
```

---

## The header should ONLY have the title after removal:

**BEFORE:**
```tsx
<div className="flex items-center justify-between px-4 py-3 border-b ...">
  <h2 className="font-semibold ...">Company Updates</h2>
  <Link href="/training" className="...">    // ← DELETE THIS
    View Training                             // ← DELETE THIS
    <ArrowRight className="w-4 h-4" />        // ← DELETE THIS
  </Link>                                     // ← DELETE THIS
</div>
```

**AFTER:**
```tsx
<div className="flex items-center justify-between px-4 py-3 border-b ...">
  <h2 className="font-semibold ...">Company Updates</h2>
</div>
```

## DO NOT TOUCH:
- Training section sidebar link
- "Go to Training" button elsewhere
- "Watch Now" link in the video card
- Any other Training-related links outside Company Updates header

---

## Testing
- [ ] "View Training →" is completely gone from Company Updates header
- [ ] Only "Company Updates" title remains in header
- [ ] Video thumbnail and content still display correctly
