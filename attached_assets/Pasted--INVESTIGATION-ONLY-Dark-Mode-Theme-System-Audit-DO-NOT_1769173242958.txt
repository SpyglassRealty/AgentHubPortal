### INVESTIGATION ONLY - Dark Mode Theme System Audit

**⚠️ DO NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES - This is an inquiry only**

**Issue:** The Training section (and possibly other sections) shows white/light background areas even when dark mode is selected. The sidebar is dark but the main content area remains light.

**Goal:** Understand how the theme system is built so we can create a proper fix.

---

## Please Investigate and Report Back On:

### 1. Theme Context/Provider
- Where is the ThemeContext defined? (file path)
- What values does it provide? (theme, setTheme, isDark, etc.)
- How does it determine the current theme? (localStorage, system preference, etc.)
- Does it add/remove a `dark` class to the document?

**Please share the full ThemeContext/ThemeProvider code.**

---

### 2. Tailwind Configuration
- What is the `darkMode` setting in `tailwind.config.js`? (should be 'class' or 'media')
- Are there any custom color configurations?
- Is there a `bg-background` color defined? If so, what are its light/dark values?

**Please share the relevant parts of `tailwind.config.js`.**

---

### 3. Global CSS
- Where are global styles defined? (globals.css, index.css, etc.)
- Are there CSS variables for background colors?
- Do those CSS variables have dark mode variants?
- Is there any hardcoded `background-color: white` or similar?

**Please share any CSS related to background colors or theme variables.**

---

### 4. Layout Component Structure
- What is the file path of the main Layout component?
- What wraps the main content area (where pages render)?
- What background classes/styles are applied to:
  - The root div
  - The main content wrapper
  - Any intermediate containers

**Please share the full Layout component code.**

---

### 5. Training Page Structure
- What background classes are applied to the Training page's root element?
- Is the Training page wrapped in any additional containers?
- Does the Training page use `isDark` or `theme` from context?

**Please share the first 50 lines of training.tsx showing imports and the main container.**

---

### 6. DOM Inspection
When dark mode is selected, please check and report:
- Does `<html>` or `<body>` have a `dark` class?
- What is the computed `background-color` of the white area?
- Which DOM element is causing the white background?

---

### 7. Other Pages Comparison
- Do other pages (Dashboard, Reports, etc.) also have this white background issue in dark mode?
- Or is this specific to the Training page?

---
