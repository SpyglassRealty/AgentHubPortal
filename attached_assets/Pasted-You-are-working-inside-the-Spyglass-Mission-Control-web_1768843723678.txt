You are working inside the Spyglass “Mission Control” web app repo. Your job is to produce a clear breakdown of remaining work to get Mission Control to a usable v1 release.

Context (what Mission Control is)

Mission Control is an internal agent dashboard for Spyglass with:

Reports: agent-level deal counts by status (Active / Pending / Closed YTD)

Leads (FUB): agent birthday, home anniversary, recent activity, plus lead listing UI

Client Data / CMA features may exist in related apps, but for Mission Control focus only on the Mission Control navigation and features.

Your output requirements

Create a single deliverable titled:

“Mission Control — Remaining Work Breakdown (v1)”

It must include:

Current State Summary (1–2 paragraphs)

What is already implemented today (based on code & UI you see)

What is partially implemented but incomplete

What’s Left (Prioritized)
Provide a prioritized list using these categories:

P0 Must-have (blocks release)

P1 Should-have (important, not blocking)

P2 Nice-to-have

Each item must include:

What’s missing (plain English)

Where in code to look (file paths or feature modules)

How to validate it works (a test/checklist step)

Reports Section — Deal Status Reporting
Specifically answer:

What’s missing to show Active / Pending / Closed YTD per agent

Whether the backend already has a stub for ReZen (or if we must decouple it)

If ReZen endpoints are unknown/403, propose a fallback plan:

“instrument UI network calls” approach (DevTools capture)

mock data mode

feature flag to disable ReZen while keeping UI intact

Leads Tab (FUB)
Confirm what’s missing for:

Agent Birthday

Home Anniversary

Recent Activity

Tag overflow behavior (“+7”, “+11” should be clickable)

Search UX: autocomplete + Search button behavior

Auth & Access Control
We want Google Login using Google Cloud Console for all Spyglass apps.

Determine if auth exists today

If not, list what’s required to implement (frontend + backend + session storage)

Ensure role-based access: only Spyglass users can access

Deployment / Domain Constraints
Ryan said:

“We don’t have access to spyglassrealty DNS — use a realtyhack subdomain”

“Advanced doesn’t work”
You must:

Identify what “Advanced” refers to in this repo (feature, plan, env, or settings)

Propose a deployment approach that works with current constraints

Final Deliverable Format
At the end, provide:

A 1-paragraph exec summary

A checkbox QA list for Ryan to verify manually

How to do the work

Inspect the repo structure and identify main routes/tabs (Dashboard / Reports / Leads).

Search codebase for keywords: reports, deals, rezen, fub, followupboss, birthday, anniversary, activity, auth, google, oauth.

If any data is mocked or disabled, call it out explicitly.

If you find errors in console/network, include them in the notes.

Important constraints

Do not guess. If something is unknown, say “UNKNOWN” and show how to verify it.

Be concrete: list file paths and exact next steps.

Keep it scoped to Mission Control (don’t drift into Client Data Portal unless it’s literally inside this repo).

Return the full breakdown in one response.
