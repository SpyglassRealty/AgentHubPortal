 FUB API Requirements Audit
Task
Analyze the current Mission Control codebase to identify which Follow Up Boss (FUB) API endpoints are needed for the project's functionality. Do NOT build anything yet — just audit and report.
What to Check
1. Search the codebase for any existing FUB references:

Search for "followupboss", "fub", "FUB", "appointments", "calendar"
Check environment variables/secrets for FUB_API_KEY or similar
Look in any API route files, services, or integrations folders

2. Review the current feature set and identify where FUB integration would apply:
Feature AreaPotential FUB UseLead capture/registrationPOST /v1/events (Registration event)Property favoritesPOST /v1/events (Saved Property event)Property inquiriesPOST /v1/events (Property Inquiry event)Calendar/scheduling/v1/appointments endpointsContact management/v1/people endpoints
3. Check for any calendar UI components:

Is there a Calendar page/section in the sidebar?
Are there any scheduling or appointment features planned?
Look for date pickers, time slot selectors, or booking flows

Output Required
Provide a report with:
## FUB API Audit Report

### Current FUB Integration Status
- [ ] FUB API Key exists in secrets: Yes/No
- [ ] Existing FUB code found: Yes/No (list files if yes)
- [ ] FUB tracking code (client-side) present: Yes/No

### Features Requiring FUB API

| Feature | FUB Endpoint Needed | Priority | Currently Implemented |
|---------|---------------------|----------|----------------------|

Important Notes

FUB appointments only return if created IN FUB (not synced from Google)
The API key owner must own the appointment to retrieve it
FUB Tracking Code (WT-MKYVRNSJ) handles client-side tracking without API

Do NOT:

Make any code changes
Install any packages
Create any files

Just analyze and report back.
