Looking at the screenshots, I can see Mission Control is working but the **My Performance** section is pulling from a single/global YentaID rather than per-user. Here's a detailed prompt for Replit Agent:

## Replit Agent Prompt: Fix Per-User YentaID Storage for My Performance

### Problem Summary
The My Performance page currently uses a single YentaID for all users. When Joey Wilkes views her Performance page, she sees Ryan's data because the YentaID is stored globally, not per-user. The disconnect button also fails because it sends an empty string to an endpoint requiring a valid UUID.

### What Needs to Change

**1. Per-User YentaID Storage**
- Each logged-in user must have their OWN YentaID stored in the database
- The `users` table (or equivalent) needs a `yentaId` column
- When a user links their ReZen account, save the YentaID to THEIR user record
- When fetching Performance data, use the CURRENT logged-in user's YentaID, not a global value

**2. Fix the Settings Page**
- The Settings page should show the CURRENT USER's linked YentaID (if any)
- Allow users to enter/update their own YentaID
- Show a "Linked" status indicator if they have a YentaID saved
- Include a working Disconnect button

**3. Fix the Disconnect Button**
- Create a proper `/api/rezen/unlink` endpoint that:
  - Clears the YentaID from the current user's record (sets to NULL)
  - Does NOT require a UUID in the request body
  - Returns success even when unlinking
- Update the frontend disconnect button to call this unlink endpoint

**4. Fix My Performance Data Fetching**
- When loading `/my-performance`, check if the CURRENT USER has a linked YentaID
- If no YentaID linked: Show a prompt to "Connect your ReZen account in Settings"
- If YentaID exists: Fetch and display THAT user's ReZen data

### Database Schema Change Needed
```sql
-- Add yentaId column to users table if not exists
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN yenta_id VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT NULL;
```

### API Endpoints to Update/Create

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/rezen/link` | POST | Save YentaID to current user's record |
| `/api/rezen/unlink` | POST | Clear YentaID from current user's record |
| `/api/rezen/status` | GET | Return current user's linked YentaID (or null) |
| `/api/rezen/performance` | GET | Fetch ReZen data using current user's YentaID |

### Expected User Flow
1. Joey logs into Mission Control
2. Goes to Settings → sees "Not connected to ReZen"
3. Enters her YentaID → clicks Connect
4. System saves YentaID to Joey's user record
5. Goes to My Performance → sees HER ReZen data
6. Ryan logs in separately → sees HIS data (different YentaID)

### Key Technical Notes
- ReZen API base: `https://arrakis.therealbrokerage.com/api/v1`
- Auth: `X-API-KEY` header (from REZEN_API_KEY secret)
- Proxy required: `http://BYA60NevyDFEbx0n:AAV9Jl4YiAKLwPvZ@geo.iproyal.com:12321`
- YentaID format: UUID (e.g., `abc123-def456-...`)

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Joey and Ryan see DIFFERENT data on My Performance
- [ ] Each user can link/unlink their own YentaID in Settings
- [ ] Disconnect button works without errors
- [ ] Unlinked users see a prompt to connect, not an error

Want me to also create a testing checklist you can use to verify this works correctly once implemented?
