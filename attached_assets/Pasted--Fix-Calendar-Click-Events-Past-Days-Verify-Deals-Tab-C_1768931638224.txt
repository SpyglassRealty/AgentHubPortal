### Fix Calendar: Click Events + Past Days + Verify Deals Tab

**Client Feedback (Yvonne Valdez):**
1. "Calendar works! I can't click on the day or open up the event for the day but can see something is there."
2. "It's showing me previous days appointments but not allowing me to click on past days to remind myself of what I did."
3. "I don't see a tab for Deals."

### Issue 1: Add Click-to-View Event Details

When a user clicks on a calendar event, open a modal showing event details.

**Add Event Click Handler:**
```typescript
const handleEventClick = (event) => {
  setSelectedEvent(event);
  setShowEventModal(true);
};
```

**Event Detail Modal should show:**
| Field | Source |
|-------|--------|
| Title | appointment.title |
| Date & Time | appointment.start / appointment.end |
| Type | appointment.type |
| Location | appointment.location |
| Contact Name | appointment.person?.name |
| Contact Phone | appointment.person?.phone |
| Contact Email | appointment.person?.email |
| Notes | appointment.description |
| Outcome | appointment.outcome |

**Modal Design:**
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Appointment Details                               [X]  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤

### Issue 2: Allow Clicking Past Days

Remove any restriction preventing clicks on past dates:
```typescript
// WRONG - prevents past date clicks
const handleDayClick = (date) => {
  if (date < new Date()) return; // Remove this
  // ...
};

// CORRECT - allow all dates
const handleDayClick = (date) => {
  setSelectedDate(date);
  // Show events for that day
};
```

Users should be able to:
- Click any day (past or future) to see that day's events
- Click any event (past or future) to see details

---

### Issue 3: Verify Deals Tab Visibility

Client reports: "I don't see a tab for Deals"

**Check sidebar navigation:**
```typescript
// In sidebar component - ensure Reports/Deals is visible
{
  name: 'Reports',  // or 'Deals'
  href: '/reports',
  icon: ChartBarIcon,
}
```

**Verify:**
- Is the Reports/Deals link in the sidebar?
- Is it conditionally hidden based on permissions?
- Is the route `/reports` accessible?

---

### Files to Update
- `client/src/pages/calendar.tsx` - Add event click handler, day click handler
- `client/src/components/event-detail-modal.tsx` - Create if doesn't exist
- `client/src/components/sidebar.tsx` - Verify Deals/Reports link

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Clicking past days works (shows events for that day)
- [ ] Clicking past events works (opens detail modal)
- [ ] Reports/Deals tab is visible in sidebar for all users
- [ ] "View in FUB" button opens the appointment in Follow Up Boss
