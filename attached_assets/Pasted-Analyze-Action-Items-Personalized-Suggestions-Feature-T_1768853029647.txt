Analyze Action Items / Personalized Suggestions Feature
Task
Analyze and document how the "Action Items / Personalized Suggestions" section on the Dashboard works. Do NOT make any changes — just investigate and report back.
What I See
On the Dashboard, there's a card on the right side that currently shows:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│            ✨                           │
│                                         │
│    No action items right now            │
│    Check back later for personalized    │
│    suggestions                          │
│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
